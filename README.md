# Portable-Charging-System
MATLAB Simulation for bidirectional EV (Electric Vehicle) charger.
This works on the princlple of bidirectional buck-boost converter.
It is used as both G2V(grid to vehicle) and V2G(vehicle to grid) charger.
It is also a portable charging system so if there is drainage of battery somewhere than from a charged battery, the EV will be charged from that battery through this charging system.
